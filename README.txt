By Golan Levin and Asa Foster III for FFFFF.AT       
Developed with Processing v.0198, a free, cross-     
platform Java programming toolkit for the arts. 
http://www.processing.org    
                                                     
ABOUT                                                
This free program loads a user-specified QR code    
image, from which it generates a topologically      
correct stencil PDF, suitable for laser-cutting.     
                                                     
INSTRUCTIONS                                         
>> QR_STENCILER has been tested in MacOSX 10.13.5.    
1. Make a QR code image which embeds a short text.    
   Try GoQR.me, Kaywa, or the Google Chart API.      
2. Download and install 'Processing' from            
   http://www.processing.org/download               
   We used Processing version 3.4.         
3. Unzip 'QR_STENCILER.zip' to a folder.            
4. Put your QR code image in 'QR_STENCILER/data/'    
5. Launch Processing and open 'QR_STENCILER.pde'     
6. Press 'Run' (Command-R) to start the stenciler.   
7. You will be prompted to Open your QR code image. 
   A default will be opened if none is provided.     
8. After doing so, the program will generate a      
   stencil PDF in the 'data' folder.                 
9. That PDF can now be opened in your favorite CAD  
   software, for laser-cutting cardboard, etc.      
10.After marking your stencil, test it with a QR     
   reader, such as TapMedia's free iPhone app.
